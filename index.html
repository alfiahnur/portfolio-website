                  <h4>Anyer</h4>  
                  <p>With my family, we went on holiday to Anyer Beach. 
                    Upon arrival, we rented a villa right on the beach.
                    We enjoyed playing in the sand and swimming in the sea. 
                    In the evening, we enjoyed dinner on the beach while watching the sunset. 
                    Around the campfire, we shared stories together. The next morning, we enjoyed
                    water activities before returning home with sweet memories of the beauty of Anyer Beach.</p>

                  <h4>Monas</h4>  
                  <p>My trip to Jakarta was really interesting! This city does have its own charm with all its glitter. 
                    From the bustling streets to the towering buildings, Jakarta is truly stunning. And Monas is certainly an unforgettable icon.
                    With a height of 132 meters and a gold monument weighing 50 kilograms, Monas is a symbol of pride for the people of Jakarta and Indonesia as a whole.
                    We hope your trip to Jakarta brings you many happy memories!</p>
